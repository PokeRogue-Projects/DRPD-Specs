The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described

## Introduction

The Daily Run Pathing Description Specifications (DRPDS) defines a standardized, language agnostic structure to describe
a path of the daily run of [pokerogue.net](https://pokerogue.net) .

It contains any and all information needed to display a daily run.

## Definitions

### DRPD Document

A self-contained resource which describes a Daily Run Path. The DRPD document MUST contain at least one date field, a
waves field and an author field. A DRPD document uses and conforms to the Daily Run Pathing Description Specification.

## Specification

### Version

The Daily Run Pathing Description Specifications is versioned using a major.minor.patch versioning scheme. The
major.minor portion of the version string (for example 1.0) SHALL designate the DRPDS feature set. .patch versions
address errors in, or provide clarifications to, this document, not the feature set. Tooling which supports DRPDS `1.0`
SHOULD be compatible with all DRPDS `1.1.*` versions. The patch version SHOULD NOT be considered by tooling, making no
distinction between `1.1.0` and `1.1.1` for example.

Occasionally, non-backwards compatible changes may be made in minor versions of the DRPDS where impact is believed to be
low relative to the benefit provided.

An DRPD document compatible with DRPDS `1.1.*` contains a required version field which designates the version of the
DRPDS that it uses.

### Format

A Daily Run Pathing document that conforms to the Daily Run Pathing Description Specifications is itself a JSON object,
which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format.

For example, if a field has an array value, the JSON array representation will be used:

```json
{
   "field": [ 1, 2, 3 ]
}
```

All field names in the specification are case-sensitive. This includes all fields that are used as keys in a map, except
where explicitly noted that keys are case-insensitive.

The schema exposes two types of fields: Fixed fields, which have a declared name, and Patterned fields, which declare a
regex pattern for the field name.

Patterned fields MUST have unique names within the containing object.

In order to preserve the ability to round-trip between YAML and JSON formats, YAML version 1.2 is RECOMMENDED along with
some additional constraints:

- Tags MUST be limited to those allowed by the JSON Schema ruleset.
- Keys used in YAML maps MUST be limited to a scalar string, as defined by the YAML Failsafe schema ruleset.

### Document Structure

A DRPD document MUST be made up of a single document.

It is RECOMMENDED that the root DRPD document be named according to the date of the daily run and an optional keyword in
the format YYYY-MM-DD_keyword : 2024-07-07_route.json or 2024-07-07_route.yaml.

### Data Types

Data types in the DRPDS are based on the types supported by
the [JSON Schema Specification Draft 2020-12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-4.2.1).

### Schema

In the following description, if a field is not explicitly **OPTIONAL**, it MUST be considered **REQUIRED**.

### DRPD Object
